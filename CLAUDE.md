## Docker Decision

### Why Docker is NOT Used

**Deployment Method Mismatch:**

- Tauri builds native binaries (.exe, .dmg, .deb) for desktop distribution
- Docker is designed for web application containerization
- Desktop apps don't benefit from containerization

**Development Complexity:**

- Tauri's development server (`npm run tauri dev`) provides sufficient hot reloading
- Docker would add unnecessary configuration overhead
- Potential performance degradation in development workflow

**Cross-Platform Building:**

- Tauri + GitHub Actions automatically generates binaries for all target platforms
- Docker only provides Linux environment, unsuitable for desktop app distribution
- Native compilation is more efficient for desktop applications

**Individual Development Considerations:**

- **Benefits**: Environment consistency, dependency isolation
- **Drawbacks**: Setup cost, performance overhead, learning curve
- **Conclusion**: For individual desktop app projects, drawbacks outweigh benefits

### Recommended Approach

1. **Local Development**: Node.js + Rust environment only
2. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated build and release
3. **Distribution**: Binary distribution via GitHub Releases

## Environment Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- Rust 1.70+
- System-dependent development tools (for each OS)

## Current Development Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features (Phase 1 & 2)

- Complete project setup with all technologies integrated
- Full blackjack game logic implementation

2. **Performance Profiling** - React DevTools optimization analysis
3. **Accessibility Audit** - WCAG compliance review and improvements
4. **Localization** - Multi-language support (Japanese, English)
5. **Advanced Game Features** - Insurance, surrender, side bets
6. **Theme System** - Dark/light modes, custom color schemes

## Architectural Pattern Recommendations

### Recommended Pattern Evolution: Container/Presentational ‚Üí Props Getter Pattern

**Evolution Path for React Components:**

1. **Container/Presentational Pattern** (Previous approach)
   - Separate container and presentational components
   - Good separation of concerns but can become verbose
   - Suitable for simple components with basic logic

2. **Props Getter Pattern** (Current recommended approach - Kent C. Dodds pattern)
   - Custom hooks extract business logic and return computed props
   - Presentation components receive all props and focus purely on UI rendering
   - Container components orchestrate logic + presentation
   - Better code reusability, testability, and cleaner architecture
   - Preferred for complex components with substantial business logic

### Props Getter Pattern Implementation Structure

```typescript
// 1. Custom Hook (Business Logic Extraction)
export const useComponentProps = (params) => {
  // All business logic, calculations, state management
  // Return computed props for presentation layer
  return { computedProp1, computedProp2, handlers };
};

// 2. Presentation Component (Pure UI Rendering)
export const ComponentPresentation = (props) => {
  // Pure UI rendering only - no business logic
  // Receives all computed props from hook
  return <div>...</div>;
};

// 3. Container Component (Orchestration)
export const Component = (props) => {
  const logic = useComponentProps(props);
  return <ComponentPresentation {...props} {...logic} />;
};
```

### Current Props Getter Pattern Implementation Status

- **Coverage**: 64% (7/11 components)
- **‚úÖ Completed**: Betting, Settings, Hand, GameControls, Card, GamePage, App
- **üîÑ In Progress**: GameHistory
- **‚è≥ Remaining**: GameStats, StatsPage

### Pattern Selection Guidelines

- **Use Props Getter Pattern for**: Complex components with substantial business logic, conditional rendering, state management
- **Use Container/Presentational for**: Simple components with minimal logic
- **Priority**: Apply Props Getter Pattern to high-complexity, frequently-used components first

**Current Status: ‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY + ARCHITECTURAL MODERNIZATION IN PROGRESS**

- All core functionality implemented and tested
- Sound effects and animations working smoothly
- Settings system with persistent user preferences
- Clean TypeScript codebase with full type safety
- Responsive design with accessibility considerations
- Modern Props Getter Pattern implementation for improved maintainability
